                        <p>Mom’s Barbecue was started back in 1987 by our grandparents, Wes and Peggy Parson in their basement in the 
                            Akron, Ohio area. In that basement they cooked, bottled and labeled every jar and bottle of sauce they made. 
                            Some of the most memorable parts of our childhood were in that basement. Memories like building forts out of the 
                            stacks of mason jar cases, and eating chicken nuggets dunked in the barbecue sauce, made only a few feet away.</p>

                        <p>They often spent time cooking ribs in competitions, with a large smoker and plenty of sauce. Memories of cooking
                             competitions and pictures of days past are something we’ll always keep. We remember making deliveries to restaurants
                              and stores and always helping with the business they loved. Sadly in the early 2000’s our grandparents decided to retire 
                              from the barbecue business and move to Florida. </p>

                        <p>Approximately 20 years later, life brought the two grandsons, Josh and Nate back together and together we decided to
                             bring back the sauce we grew up on. We both love to smoke food and cook for large groups of people, so barbecue is our 
                             ideal way of cooking. Now being in Texas, we decided to bring back our grandparent’s signature sauce and have developed 
                             a rib rub of our own.</p>
